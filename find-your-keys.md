Finding your keys
-----

Your ionic.io application has three important pieces of information; the App ID, Public API Key, and Private API Key.  
You will use these to authenticate with our APIs and enable services.

## The App ID

Assuming you've uploaded your application to apps.ionic.io using `ionic upload` as described 
<a href="/getting-started">here</a>, you can find your App ID easily on the 
<a href="apps.ionic.io">landing page</a> as seen here:

## The Public and Private API Key

To find your API Keys, simply click on <strong>Ionic Services (alpha)</strong> for one of your apps, then navigate to 
the <strong>Config</strong> tab.  You should see a dashboard like the one below, with your api keys listed at the 
bottom.  You may need to click <strong>Show Secret</strong> to see the private key.
