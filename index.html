    The Ionic Platform makes it easy to build, test, deploy, and scale your hybrid mobile apps with our suite
    of hybrid app services and tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    Combined with the open source Ionic SDK, the Ionic Platform adds powerful backend services and developer tools
    focused exclusively on the hybrid app development process to give Ionic developers an edge, even over
    native apps.
