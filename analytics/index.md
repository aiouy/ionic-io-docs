Overview of Ionic Analytics
-----

The Ionic Analytics service makes it easy to add powerful analytics to your hybrid mobile apps.

Unlike other analytics providers, Ionic can infer user behavior through the deep
integration of the analytics system with the UI layer. This means Ionic can automatically
track taps and interactions and also associate events with various states in your app's routing (to generate heatmaps, for example).

Interested? First go through the main [getting started](/getting-started) guide to install the core platform client libraries. Then head on over to the [analytics starter guide](/analytics/setup) to set up the analytics service.
